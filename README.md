# CleverCart
This is the coding problem for CleverCart

This is a Python script that uses the recipe_scrapers library to scrape recipe data from various websites and store the data in a CSV file. The script allows you to add as many URLs as you want to scrape and then iterates over each URL to extract the relevant data. The data is then written to a CSV file named "test_recipes.csv".

You will also need to install the following libraries:
1. recipe_scrapers
2. csv
3. re

The final CSV file contains the following columns:
1. Recipe Name
2. Description
3. Instructions
4. Grocery Item Names
5. Grocery Item Quantity
6. Cook Time
7. Serving Size

Clams Casino Stuffed Pasta Shells,"Clams Casino Stuffed Pasta Shells are a twist on one of my childhood appetizer favorites - clams casino. Bacon, clams, peppers, cream, and cheese are stuffed into pasta shells for a truly incredible dinner.","1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Spread out bread cubes in a the prepared baking sheet, and bake in the oven until it they are completely dried, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl.
3. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, crispy, and all the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat, push crisp bacon to one side of the skillet, and drain most of the rendered fat.
4. Turn heat back on medium-high and add diced onions and peppers. Cook until they just start to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add reserved clam juice, and cook, stirring, until half the liquid has been reduced, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Transfer skillet contents into the bowl with the bread cubes.Pour in reserved clams and toss to combine. Add ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, parsley, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate until needed.
6. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and whisk in flour until mixture turns into a light tan color, about 2 minutes. Add cold milk all at once, and whisk until smooth. Cook, whisking often, until sauce begins to simmer, 3 to 5 minutes. Sauce will not be very thick, but will thicken when baked with the shells.
7. Remove sauce from heat, and transfer 3/4 of it into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Reserve the rest for the top.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shell in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until about 75% tender, about 9 minutes (full cooking time would be 12 minutes). Drain and cover with just enough cold water to cover to prevent shells from drying out.
9. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
10. Stuff 20 shells with plenty of clam-bread mixture, and place on top of sauce, making 5 rows of 4 shells. Top with remaining white sauce and sprinkle with remaining grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.
11. Bake in the preheated oven until pasta is fully tender, sauce is bubbling around the edges, and the cheese on top is starting to brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Top with additional chopped parsley if desired, and serve immediately.

Deep-Fried Turkey,Try this deep-fried turkey recipe for outdoor holiday cooking that frees up your oven. It's juicy and tender on the inside and super crispy on the outside.,"1. Fill a turkey fryer or large stockpot with enough oil to fry turkey; be sure to leave room for turkey so oil doesn't spill over. Heat oil to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Layer a large platter with food-safe paper bags.
2. Rinse turkey and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Rub seasoning inside the cavity and all over the outer surfaces. Make sure the hole at the neck is open at least 2 inches so oil can flow freely into the cavity.
3. Turn off the heat source. Place whole onion into the drain basket followed by turkey, neck-end first. Slowly lower the basket into the fryer until turkey is completely submerged in oil. Turn on the heat source and cook, maintaining oil temperature at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes, or 3 1/2 minutes per pound.
4. Carefully remove the basket from the fryer and drain turkey. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) but no more than 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Transfer turkey to the prepared platter to finish draining, 10 to 15 minutes.
